This eCommerce website is a full-stack application built using PHP and MySQL, designed for both customers and admins. Customers can register, log in, browse products, manage a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. Admins have access to a secure dashboard where they can add, edit, or delete products. The backend uses a structured database with tables for users, products, and cart data. Security features include password hashing and session management, with role-based access control for admins. This project highlights core skills in web development, database integration, and user interface design.
